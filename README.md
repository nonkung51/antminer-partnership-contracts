# antminer-partnership-contracts
Me and my friend pool together to bought Antminer to mine bitcoin around a year ago,
the thing is I thought that it might be fun to create some smart contract to distribute
share of each one in the partnership. 🧐

So yeah this happen i spend around an hour to get this smart contract up and running (in which hopefully no bugs 🤫) and i think it migh be cool to share. 😂

The idea was simple there's 2 contract in this project

1. Token represent how many share each one have this one was implement using ERC20 contract from Openzeppelin
2. Partnership itself that would provide function to withdraw BTCB (Oh we use BSC btw!)

feel free to take a look! 😄
